# array-multiplier-verilog
I've made this for an assignment, but I'm saving this here both for me to not lose this, and in case someone might need this in the future.

There are 2 files, one for unsigned multiplication, another one that is more optimized and with modified Baugh - Wooley for signed numbers.

Also I don't give any assurances of this working, use this as guidance for your own implementation.
